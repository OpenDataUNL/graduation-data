# UNL Graduation and Retention Data

### Statement of purpose

The purpose of this repository is quite simple: The Office of Instutional Research, Analytics and Decision Support at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln apparently believes, by its actions, that a PDF is a data format. An office entirely dedicated to data posts only PDFs of said data on [its website](http://irads.unl.edu/). To get any other form of data from them, you must request it. Requests are filled on a first-come, first-served basis, if at all. 

We do not believe a PDF is an acceptable data format for information that is clearly a public record. This site has taken the PDFs posted by the IRADS and converted them into CSV files, which are actually useful for analysis.

We also have included the original PDF for reference.

Included in this repository (very soon):

* [Graduation Rates by College, 10 Year Trend](http://irads.unl.edu/dmdocuments/050_Fall_2015_graduation_rate_by_college.pdf)
* [Retention Rates by College, 10 Year Trend](http://irads.unl.edu/dmdocuments/050_Fall_2015_retention_rate_by_college.pdf)
